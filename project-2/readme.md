**It has been very stressful**

*Very Stressful*

Feedback
1. I looked for the quiz for a long time before I realized that it wasn't live and thats why I couldn't find it.
2. This week was definitely easier than the last.
3. I still feel pretty lost about how to submit things and what needs to be submitted and when something is "done"
