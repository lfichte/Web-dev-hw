**Code** - We can identify code, like `var Der = 20`,  in a paragraph using the back-tick character. On most American keyboards, the back-tick is the leftmost key on number line, below esc.

**Code Blocks** - Blocks are created by surrounding code with three back-ticks and delineating its language:

```markdown
# This is a code block.
## It is written in Markdown.
```
